# SpaNSalon

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project was developed as an academic project during my BCA 6th semester. 

The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive and user-friendly application that could be used for spa and salon management. Throughout the development process, I utilized C# and other tools such as bootstrap, MS SQL Server and many others to ensure that the application was both functional and efficient. 

The application provides users with:
- User authentication and authorization
- Service selection and booking
- User dashboard
- Admin dashboard

making it an invaluable tool for males and females of various age groups.

Our web application, built using C# and ASP.NET, provides a seamless and convenient way for users to manage their spa and salon needs. With just a few clicks, customers can order on-site spa services right from the comfort of their own home or office. Our easy-to-use platform makes booking appointments and choosing services a breeze.

Our app offers a comprehensive list of spa services including facials, massages, pedicures, and manicures. Users can browse and select the services they need, choose the date and time that works best for them, and receive confirmation of their appointment via email.

We understand the importance of quality and personalized service, which is why our app allows users to choose their preferred service provider based on reviews and ratings. Customers can also leave their own feedback and ratings after their appointment to help others make informed decisions.

With our user-friendly interface and convenient online booking system, managing your spa and salon needs has never been easier. Whether you're looking for a quick pedicure or a full-day spa experience, our app is the perfect solution for all your pampering needs.
